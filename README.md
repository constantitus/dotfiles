## About
My dotfiles and scripts for hyprland and some other things I use.\
*This repo used to contain my bspwm dotfiles. I've switched to hyprland, but my old dotfiles are still here*

## Dependencies:
- Hyprland (obviously)
- waybar
- wofi
- swww (for wallpapers)
- wl-clipboard
- slurp and grim (screenshots and processing)
- Wezterm
## Misc packages:
- zsh
- I use alacritty as a fallback terminal
- xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (for screen sharing and obs)
- wl-recorder (screen recording)
- hyprpicker (does what xprop does on xorg)
- gtklock if you want a lockscreen, but I'd suggest something else.
## Things I use
- Neovim
- Sayonara (qt based music player)
- qt5ct-svg-translucent from AUR (qt theme transparency)
- discord-screenaudio (only works with pipewire)

I use pipewire with wireplumber for sound.

## Installation
Clone the repo into your $HOME folder\
Change the monitor names in the hyprland config\
Configure to your liking

## TODO
- [ ] A vertical monitor (important)
